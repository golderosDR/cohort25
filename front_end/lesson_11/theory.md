- Functions: Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. There are several ways to declare functions in JavaScript, including function declarations, anonymous functions, functional expressions, and arrow functions.

- Arrays: Arrays are a data structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single variable. JavaScript provides several built-in methods for working with arrays, including map(), filter(), reduce(), and forEach().

- Objects: Objects are a way to represent complex data structures using key-value pairs. They can be defined using object literals or classes, and can be used to store and organize data.

- Inheritance: Inheritance is a way to allow objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. In JavaScript, inheritance can be achieved using classes and the extends keyword.

- this keyword: The this keyword in JavaScript refers to the current object. It is commonly used within methods of an object to refer to the object itself.
